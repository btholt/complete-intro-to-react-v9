You did it!</p>
<p>This is a lot of material to take in, so congrats on sticking with it. Hopefully it was fun and maybe made you support your local pizzeria along the way!</p>
<p>You are now fully equipped to write React professionally. Everything you learned here is 95%+ of what you would need to write React at any tech company. The last 5% is what I&#39;ll teach you in <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/intermediate-react-v6/">Intermediate React v6</a> which has more to do with server-side React and advance performance techniques. But for now, this is almost all you need to know!</p>
<p>So what should you do from here?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v5/">Intermediate React v5</a> is still very relevant! Take this course and learn more about Tailwind, server-side rendering, more hooks, Redux, and a bunch of there cool things. I&#39;ll update this when the new Intermediate React v6 comes out.</li>
<li>Follow the rest of the <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/learn/react/">Frontend Masters React Learning Path</a>.</li>
<li>Build your own app!! I cannot stress how important it is with concepts like this to just build. Take the dumbest idea in your head and make it. Nothing can replace experience!<ul>
<li>An e-commerce website to sell single socks so you can match unmatched socks</li>
<li>An AI prompt text editor</li>
<li>A music app that lets you add Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal songs to it.</li>
<li>A client to let you read Thread, X, and Bluesky in the same app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/topics/next-js/">Next.js</a>, Remix/React-Router (soon those will be the same thing) or some other way of doing React on the server</li>
<li>Learn React + <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/tailwind-css/">Tailwind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of way to go with this and they&#39;re all fun! I hope you enjoyed the course and I look forward to hopefully getting to teach with you again soon!</p>
