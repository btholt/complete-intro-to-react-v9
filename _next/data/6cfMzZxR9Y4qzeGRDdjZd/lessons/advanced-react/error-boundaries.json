It works mostly the same as a function component.\n- Instead of the useState hook you'll use `this.state` which is an object that contains all state for that component.\n- To change state, you'll use a `this.setState({ key: \"value\" })` function. This allows you to change state like your `setKey` hook would have.\n- Instead of useEffect, you use lifecycle methods. componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, etc. To read more about them, [go here][lifecycle].\n- Instead of a props parameter being passed into the function, you'll use `this.props`.\n- This is enough here. You shouldn't be authoring class components anymore except for error boundaries. But you may encounter them in legacy React codebases.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Link } from \"@tanstack/react-router\";\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends Component {\n  state = { hasError: false };\n  static getDerivedStateFromError() {\n    return { hasError: true };\n  }\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n    console.error(\"ErrorBoundary caught an error\", error, info);\n  }\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return (\n        <div className=\"error-boundary\">\n          <h2>Uh oh!</h2>\n          <p>\n            There was an error with this listing. <Link to=\"/\">Click here</Link>{\" \"}\n            to back to the home page.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ErrorBoundary;\n```\n\n- Now anything that is a child of this component will have errors caught here.

This works in function components too.\n- Because we just return children if there's no error, the ErrorBoundary component doesn't render anything itself if there are no errors.\n\nLet's go make PastOrderRoute use it in case the API throws an error.\n\n```javascript\n// add import\nimport ErrorBoundary from \"../ErrorBoundary\";\n\n// replace Route export\nexport const Route = createLazyFileRoute(\"/past\")({\n  component: ErrorBoundaryWrappedPastOrderRoutes,\n});\n\n// beneath Route export\nfunction ErrorBoundaryWrappedPastOrderRoutes() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <PastOrdersRoute />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n- Now this is totally self contained.
