Consider this a sneak peak into what is coming, not what to do today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vitest is beginning to support more deeply browser-based testing. To those of us that have been around long enough to remember Selenium, this may strike fear deep int your heart. But fear not! Browser-based testing tools have come so far along since then that it&#39;s both fast and reliable, in particular thanks to the Microsoft project <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a>.</p>\n<p>However this is still early days. I&#39;m going to show you how to set it up but be warned that this prone to change as they&#39;re still actively working on it!</p>\n<p>So first let&#39;s install the libraries we need.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\">npm i -D @vitest/browser@2.1.3 playwright@1.48.0 vitest-browser-react@0.0.1\n</code></pre><p>You can see that the vitest-browser-react library is still 0.0.1 as of writing so be extra aware it&#39;s likely to have changed by the time you read this.</p>\n<p>Okay, so now we want to write browser based tests. But we have also have a bunch of existing Node.js-based tests. Some our already-existing Node.js based tests won&#39;t work in the browser. But no worries, Vitest/Vite has a tool just for this, workspaces. It&#39;s actually made to handle monorepos, but it will work here just as well. Make a file called <code>vitest.workspace.js</code> (you don&#39;t normally need this as your Vite config is normally enough.)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { defineWorkspace } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;vitest/config&quot;</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">defineWorkspace</span>([\n  {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">extends</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;./vite.config.js&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">test</span>: {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">include</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;**/*.node.test.{js,jsx}&quot;</span>],\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;happy-dom&quot;</span>,\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">environment</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;happy-dom&quot;</span>,\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">extends</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;./vite.config.js&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">test</span>: {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">setupFiles</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;vitest-browser-react&quot;</span>],\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">include</span>: [<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;**/*.browser.test.{js,jsx}&quot;</span>],\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;browser&quot;</span>,\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">browser</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">provider</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;playwright&quot;</span>,\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">enabled</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>,\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">name</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;firefox&quot;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// you can use chromium or webkit here too</span>\n      },\n    },\n  },\n]);\n</code></pre><p>Now delete the <code>test</code> items from your vite.config.js file.</p>\n<p>This is a test-only config for Vite (and therefore Vitest.)
