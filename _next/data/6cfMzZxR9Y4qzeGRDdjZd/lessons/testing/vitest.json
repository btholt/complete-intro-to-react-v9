This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating Vitest with @testing-library/react for efficient React testing, drawing on similarities with Jasmine and Jest APIs to deliver seamless testing experiences.

The idea behind Vitest is that you already have a complete build pipeline for making an app, why should that pipeline be any different for test? It shouldn't; you want your testing environment to look as much like your app environment as possible.\n\nThey designed it to be a drop-in replacement for [Jest][jest] which is what I have taught for this course since the beginning. Jest is great and still a very viable tool to use for testing, even with Vite. We're just going to use Vitest because 1. we don't have to do any more configuration and 2. 100% of what you will learn in here is going to be useful if you use Jest. Win-win. If you want to learn Jest specifically, [take a look at Intermediate React v4's testing section.][v4]\n\n> Fun side note: [Jest is now an OpenJS project and no longer directly under Facebook][fb].\n\nWhile Vitest is not using Jasmine directly, its APIs mimic Jasmine APIs (just like Jest.)\n\nLet's get going. Run `npm install -D vitest@2.1.3 @testing-library/react@16.0.1 happy-dom@15.7.4`.\n\n`@testing-library/react`, formerly called `react-testing-library`, is a tool that has a bunch of convenience features that make testing React significantly easier and is now the recommended way of testing React, supplanting [Enzyme][enzyme]. Previous versions of this course teach Enzyme if you'd like to see that (though I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to.)\n\nWe need to tell Vitest that we need a browser-like environment which it will fulfill via the [happy-dom][hd] package. happy-dom is a lot like jsdom but smaller, doesn't do 100% of what the browser does, and is much, much faster.\n\nNext go into your src directory and create a folder called `__tests__`.

In this case, Vitest assumes all JS files in here are tests.\n\nLet's go add an npm script. In your package.json.\n\n```json\n\"test\": \"vitest\"\n```\n\n> Fun trick: if you call it test, npm lets you run that command as just `npm t`.\n\nThis command lets you run Vitest in an interactive mode where it will re-run tests selectively as you save them.
