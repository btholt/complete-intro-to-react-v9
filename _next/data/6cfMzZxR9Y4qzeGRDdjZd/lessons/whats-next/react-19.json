Then we&#39;ll cover a few that we&#39;ll actually add code to our app for.</p>\n<h2>&#39;use client&#39; and &#39;use server&#39;</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s start with one of the bigger shifts in React. We will cover this <em>extensively</em> in Intermediate React so if you are curious, check that course out when it comes out. Essentially we can indicate to React &quot;hey, only run this component on the server&quot; or likewise, &quot;hey, only render this client side&quot;. Why would you do that?</p>\n<p>For server components, we can do things like reference server-side secrets, query databases, call private APIs, or other things that we want data for our client side app but we can&#39;t query client-side without risking leaking secrets or DDOS. All of the logic will be executed server-side and then the finished component will be sent down to the client. Pretty cool, right?</p>\n<p>They&#39;re even taking it step further with taintUniqueValue and taintObjectReference. These allow a developer to say &quot;hey, this is super sensitive information, make sure this never is sent to the client&quot;. You would use this with like an API key, a database connection string, or some other secret that you wouldn&#39;t want to accidentally leak. I love this because what if a developer changes a &#39;use server&#39; directive to a &#39;use client&#39; directive? They may not notice and send it to production accidentally, causing a data breach. With the concept of taint, you can make sure that never happens.</p>\n<p>&#39;use client&#39; is the opposite ‚Äì something that would never make sense to render server-side. Think like a highly interactive component like a text editor or a maps widget or something like that ‚Äì it&#39;s meant to be a client-side experience so you better off just passing all the down to the client immediately and let them do the rendering. Keep in mind that you don&#39;t need to use this directive unless you are doing server-side rendering. By default it will still do client-side rendering.</p>\n<h2>Putting stuff in the head</h2>\n<p>Imagine you want your React component to add <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> or other HTML pages in the doc. Right now you either need to use a portal or you need something like <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">react-helmet</a> to do that. With React 19, you just need to render the tag and it will automatically stick it in the header.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">MyPizza</span> = (<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>) =&gt; (\n  <span class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>I love pizza<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">title</span>&gt;</span>üçï Brian Loves Pizza üçï<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">title</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span></span>\n);\n</code></pre><p>Now whenever MyPizza gets rendered it will change the title of the doc (which what shows up in browser tab).</p>\n<h2>preload and preconnect</h2>\n<p>Two pretty helpful functions to help give hints to the browser of what it may want to start loading in the background.

Then we'll cover a few that we'll actually add code to our app for.\n\n## 'use client' and 'use server'\n\nLet's start with one of the bigger shifts in React. We will cover this _extensively_ in Intermediate React so if you are curious, check that course out when it comes out. Essentially we can indicate to React \"hey, only run this component on the server\" or likewise, \"hey, only render this client side\".

Keep in mind that you don't need to use this directive unless you are doing server-side rendering. By default it will still do client-side rendering.\n\n## Putting stuff in the head\n\nImagine you want your React component to add `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<title>` or other HTML pages in the doc. Right now you either need to use a portal or you need something like [react-helmet][helmet] to do that. With React 19, you just need to render the tag and it will automatically stick it in the header.\n\n```javascript\nconst MyPizza = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>I love pizza</h1>\n    <title>üçï Brian Loves Pizza üçï</title>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nNow whenever MyPizza gets rendered it will change the title of the doc (which what shows up in browser tab).\n\n## preload and preconnect\n\nTwo pretty helpful functions to help give hints to the browser of what it may want to start loading in the background. If you are not familiar with the concepts, [head here][preload] to read more, but long story short it's for things like images, fonts, scripts, stylesheets, etc. You can let the browser know \"hey, we're likely to going to need load these soon, can you either preconnect to this URL to get ready to download it or just go ahead and preload it?\" This will allow your user to have more instantaneous experiences since they won't need to wait for these things to load when required.

Suffice to say, it was possible but impractical.\n\nNow with React 19 it will just handle all of that caretaking of the custom elements for you, just treat it like any other normal tag and React will do all the babysitting for you.
