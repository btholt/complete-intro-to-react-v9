Generally speaking, React is in its \"unoptimized\" state is fast enough and adding these performance hacks on top make shave a millisecond here or there off, but in general aren't worth doing unless it's a big gain because it makes it harder to code with.\n\nSpecifically I'm talking about [useMemo][memo] and [useCallback][callback]. These two tools allow you to control when React will re-render your app. If you're rendering a massive spreadsheet and it's not changing frequently but its parent is, you can use useMemo to say \"hey, this doesn't need to re-render unless this condition is true\". This only really helps when it's a big thing like this. I don't even teach this in this course because you use it very infrequently and some newer devs get tempted to use it all the time.
