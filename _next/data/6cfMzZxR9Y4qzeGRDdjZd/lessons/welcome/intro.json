In this course you will go from not knowing anything about React to being job ready. This course teaches all the core concepts of React aiming to be the most useful. You will learn React from a first-principles methodology ‚Äì we will start with no build tools or anything like that, just vanilla JavaScript and React. Over time we add tools like Vite, JSX, ESLint, Prettier, etc. so you can learn how to construct your own stack from scratch.

This course is for anyone looking to get started in React or deepen their expertise in it. No experience is necessary. However, I guarantee anyone who is interested in React will learn something in here. This probably shouldn&#39;t be your first programming or JavaScript course, but beyond that, it should be comfortable for anyone. We do use some Node.js to run our little API and for the build tools but no real Node.js experience is necessary, I&#39;ll give you the commands necessary to run it.</p>\n<h2>Who am I?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/social-share-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Brian teaching\"></p>\n<p>My name is Brian Holt and I&#39;ve been writing React for a long time.
